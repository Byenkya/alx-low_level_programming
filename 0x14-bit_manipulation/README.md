The bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations in the c programming language. When we use the bitwise 
operators, the operations are performed based on the binary values. The following table describes all the bitwise 
operators in the C programming language.
Let us consider two variables A and B as A = 25 (11001) and B = 20 (10100).
